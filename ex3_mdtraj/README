SARS-CoV-2 attachment to host cells is mediated by a protein-protein
interaction between the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2
spike and the human ACE2 receptor. We performed a 75 μs conventional
MD simulation of a chimeric RBD in complex with ACE2 (PDB entry 6VW1)
[REF1]. In the simulation the complex was stable, and no dissociation events
were observed. We also performed preliminary accelerated weighted ensemble
(AWE) [REF2] MD simulations of the complex, which facilitated sampling of
hundreds of binding and thousands of unbinding events over an aggregate 30
μs of AWE simulation. We provide below the conventional MD simulation,
all ~415,000 conformations sampled during the AWE simulations, and the
corresponding graph adjacency matrix with weights. From analysis of the AWE
simulation data, we also provide four representative trajectories containing
binding events and a free energy landscape estimated using a history-augmented
Markov state model [REF3].

The complex model was solvated in a ~140 Å box of 200 mM NaCl and water,
and parameterized with the DES-Amber protein and ion force field [REF4], the
TIP4P-D water model [REF5], and an in-house force field derived from GAFF
[REF6]. Simulations were performed under the NPT ensemble at 300 K. During
the AWE simulations, we used a 100.8 ps resampling interval to enhance the
sampling of (i) the distance between the RBD and ACE2 centers of mass, (ii)
the total number of atomic contacts between the RBD and ACE2, and (iii)
the complex pRMSD (the square root of the product of the RMSD of the RBD
after aligning on ACE2 and the RMSD of ACE2 after aligning on the RBD).

Viewing in VMD
==============

This trajectory may be viewed using the VMD version 1.8.7 or later (or
any other tool capable of reading files in DCD and Maestro format).
The VMD software is available from the Theoretical and Computational
Biophysics Group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,

To view the full trajectory, change to the unpacked trajectory directory
and use the command:

  $ vmd {TRAJECTORY}/*.mae {TRAJECTORY}/*.dcd

Depending on the number of frames in the dataset, and the amount of memory
on your system, you might need to pass only a subset of the DCD files on
the command line.
