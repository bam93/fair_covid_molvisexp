# FAIR sharing of molecular visualization experiences

This is a data and code collection (fair_covid_molvisexp) for our publication on [biorxiv](link to come) experimenting with FAIR sharing of molecular visualization experiences. We initially provide four example scripts for the [UnityMol](http://unitymol.sourceforge.net) software.

## Contents

- `ex1_spike`: The first example aims at setting up a simple structural view of the SARS spike glycoprotein  complex with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The trimeric complex accessible from PDB-id 6CS2 [24] was used as starting point for many early SARS-CoV-2 studies.
