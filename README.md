# FAIR sharing of molecular visualization experiences

This is a data and code collection (`fair_covid_molvisexp`) for our publication available as preprint on [biorxiv](dx.doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.27.270140) experimenting with FAIR sharing of molecular visualization experiences. We initially provide four example scripts for the [UnityMol](http://unitymol.sourceforge.net) software as well as derived media such as images, movies and 3D models.

## Contents

- `ex1_spike`: The first example aims at setting up a simple structural view of the SARS spike glycoprotein  complex with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The trimeric complex accessible from PDB-id 6CS2 [24] was used as starting point for many early SARS-CoV-2 studies.
