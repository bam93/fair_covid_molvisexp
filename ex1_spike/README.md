Example 1: a simple structural view of the SARS spike glycoprotein complex with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 
=

The structure of the viral spike ectodomain with PDB-id 6CS2 is taken from Kirchdoerfer et al., Sci Rep 8:15701(2018). 


1) Ensemble view
--

Show the S1 and S2 subunits in interaction with the ACE2 enzyme.
S1 regions are shown in blue and S2 regions are shown in green, ACE2 is shown in orange.
The one S1 RBD region interacting with ACE2 is in an "up" conformation.

Make the trimeric form visible

select the one in up state

show glycosylation shield


2) Zoom in on pre-fusion peptide region
-

3) Zoom in on central helix conformational change
-
